# GeoWGAN-GP
Code for training a WGAN-GP to reconstruct two-dimensional backscatter electron microscopy images of geological rock samples. More details can be found in **Quantifying complex microstructures of earth material: Reconstructing higher-order spatial correlations using deep generative adversarial networks**.

#How to run the code?
* To run the code for training WGAN-GP type: train.py  -ip " path to the large segmented image in the Original_images folder".
* Other paramter is '-project_name' which is Meta-igneous by default but you can define your own name. it will create a folder where your training images will be saved.
